# No-Distraction-Dark-Mode-HTML-Webpage

Sometimes you just need a blank homepage so you can think and chill out in between projects. The HTML page, Title and Favicon are all in dark mode.
There are two parts to this:

‚úÖ HTML Homepage

‚úÖ Favicon


The HTML Webpage uses simple code to create a "dark mode" page. It points to a black colored Favicon, so the tab will be in dark mode as well. The HTML title, which appears on the browser tab, is also blank, with the following code:

```HTML
<title>&#65279;</title>
```

How to setup:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Decide where you will store the two files (HTML and Favicon). I recommend My Documents.
   
2Ô∏è‚É£ Change the below code in the HTML file to reflect the directory where you will store the Favicon:
```HTML
<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/Users/name/Documents/favicon.ico">
```
3Ô∏è‚É£ Put the HTML file in the same directory as the Favicon.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Rename the HTML file as you wish.

5Ô∏è‚É£ In your browser, set the Homepage to the HTML file that you renamed.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Make sure your browser is set to display the homepage icon.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Click the homepage icon and enjoy a few moments of quiet thinking..

Here is the HTML if you want to copy and paste it:

```HTML
<html>
<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/Users/name/Documents/favicon.ico">
<head><title>&#65279;</title></head>
<body bgcolor="black">
</body>
</html>
```

Bonus Section:

ü™Ñ Redirect to HTML pages based on the time of day. Someone may want two sets of links - one for day (work related) and one for night.
In the below, you create two additional webpages - index-day.html and index-night.html. The code is currently 
set to redirect index-day.html between 6am and 7pm (the 6 and 19 variables). No special code needed for the day and night index pages. Change the links 
as you wish (perhaps to even non-HTML links). An HTML of the below is available for download.

```HTML
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8" />

<title>Links</title>

</head>
<body>
<script type="text/javascript">
// var SpecialRedirectURL = ['night.html','morning.html','day.html','eve.html'];
var SpecialRedirectURL = [
   'index-night.html',
   'index-day.html'
];

function specRedirect() {
  var currentTime = new Date();
  var currentHour = currentTime.getHours();
  var Hour = 0;
  if ( (currentHour >= 6) && (currentHour < 19) ) { Hour = 1; }
//  alert(Hour+' goes to: '+SpecialRedirectURL[Hour]);
  window.location.href = SpecialRedirectURL[Hour];
}  

window.onload = function() {
  specRedirect(); 
}

</script>
</body>
</html>
```

Ideas for forks..
