# No-Distraction-Dark-Mode-HTML-Webpage

Sometimes you just need a blank homepage so you can think and chill-out in between projects. 
There are two parts to this - 

• HTML Homepage
• Favicon

The HTML Homepage uses simple code to create a "dark mode" page. It points to a black colored Favicon, so the tab will be in dark mode as well.

How to setup
1. Decide where you will store the two files (HTML and Favicon). I recommend My Documents.
2. Change the code here to reflect the directory where you will store the Favicon.
<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/Users/yourname/Documents/favicon.ico">
3. Put the HTML file in the same directory as the Favicon.
4. Rename the HTML file as you wish.
5. In your browser, set the Homepage to the HTML file.

Enjoy!
