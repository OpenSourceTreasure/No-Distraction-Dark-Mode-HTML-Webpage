# No-Distraction-Dark-Mode-HTML-Webpage

Sometimes you just need a blank homepage so you can think and chill out in between projects. 
There are two parts to this:

• HTML Homepage

• Favicon


The HTML Homepage uses simple code to create a "dark mode" page. It points to a black colored Favicon, so the tab will be in dark mode as well.

How to setup:

• Decide where you will store the two files (HTML and Favicon). I recommend My Documents.
   
• Change the code here to reflect the directory where you will store the Favicon.
<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/Users/yourname/Documents/favicon.ico">

• Put the HTML file in the same directory as the Favicon.

• Rename the HTML file as you wish.

• In your browser, set the Homepage to the HTML file that you renamed.

• Make sure your browser is set to display the homepage icon.

• Click the homepage icon and enjoy a few moments of quiet thinking..


Ideas for forks:

• Display different text (or any content) based on the time. Someone may want a list of links during the day, but a blank page at night.

• Change the colors

• Add minimalist content like the weather

• Whatever else you can think of!


Enjoy!
