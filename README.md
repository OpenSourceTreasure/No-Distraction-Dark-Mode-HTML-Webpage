# No-Distraction-Dark-Mode-HTML-Webpage

Sometimes you just need a blank homepage so you can think and chill out in between projects. The HTML page, Title and Favicon are all in dark mode.
There are two parts to this:

✅ HTML Homepage

✅ Favicon


The HTML Webpage uses simple code to create a "dark mode" page. It points to a black colored Favicon, so the tab will be in dark mode as well.

How to setup:

1️⃣ Decide where you will store the two files (HTML and Favicon). I recommend My Documents.
   
2️⃣ Change the code here to reflect the directory where you will store the Favicon:
```HTML
<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/Users/yourname/Documents/favicon.ico">
```
3️⃣ Put the HTML file in the same directory as the Favicon.

4️⃣ Rename the HTML file as you wish.

5️⃣ In your browser, set the Homepage to the HTML file that you renamed.

6️⃣ Make sure your browser is set to display the homepage icon.

7️⃣ Click the homepage icon and enjoy a few moments of quiet thinking..


Ideas for forks:

💡 Display different text (or any content) based on the time. Someone may want a list of links during the day, but a blank page at night.

💡 Change the colors

💡 Add minimalist content like the weather

💡 Whatever else you can think of..


Enjoy!
