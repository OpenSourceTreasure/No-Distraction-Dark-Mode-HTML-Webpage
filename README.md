# No-Distraction-Dark-Mode-HTML-Webpage

Sometimes you just need a blank homepage so you can think and chill out in between projects. 
There are two parts to this:

• HTML Homepage

• Favicon

The HTML Homepage uses simple code to create a "dark mode" page. It points to a black colored Favicon, so the tab will be in dark mode as well.

How to setup
1. Decide where you will store the two files (HTML and Favicon). I recommend My Documents.
2. Change the code here to reflect the directory where you will store the Favicon.
<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/Users/yourname/Documents/favicon.ico">
3. Put the HTML file in the same directory as the Favicon.
4. Rename the HTML file as you wish.
5. In your browser, set the Homepage to the HTML file that you renamed.
6. Make sure your browser is set to display the homepage icon
7. Click the homepage icon and enjoy a few moments of quiet thinking..

Ideas for forks:
• Display different text (or any content) based on the time. Someone may want a list of links during the day, but a blank page at night.
• Change the colors
• Add minimalist content like the weather
• Whatever else you can think of!


Enjoy!
