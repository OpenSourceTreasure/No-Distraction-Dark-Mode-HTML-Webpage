# No-Distraction-Dark-Mode-HTML-Webpage

Sometimes you just need a blank webpage to look at so you can think and chill out in between projects. The HTML page, Title and Favicon are all in dark mode.
There are two parts to this:

‚úÖ HTML Webpage

‚úÖ Favicon


The HTML Webpage uses simple code to create a "dark mode" page. It points to a black colored Favicon, so the tab will be in dark mode as well. The HTML title, which appears on the browser tab, is also blank, with the following code:

```HTML
<title>&#65279;</title>
```

How to setup:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Decide where you will store the two files (HTML and Favicon). I recommend My Documents.
   
2Ô∏è‚É£ Change the below code in the HTML file to reflect the directory where you will store the Favicon:
```HTML
<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/Users/name/Documents/favicon.ico">
```
3Ô∏è‚É£ Put the HTML file in the same directory as the Favicon.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Rename the HTML file as you wish.

5Ô∏è‚É£ In your browser, set the Homepage to the HTML file that you renamed.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Make sure your browser is set to display the homepage icon.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Click the homepage icon and enjoy a few moments of quiet thinking..

Here is the HTML if you want to copy and paste it:

```HTML
<html>
<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/Users/name/Documents/favicon.ico">
<head><title>&#65279;</title></head>
<body bgcolor="black">
</body>
</html>
```

1Ô∏è‚É£ Redirect to HTML pages based on time of day 

Someone may want two sets of links - one for day (work related) and one for night.
In the below, you create two additional webpages - index-day.html and index-night.html. The code is currently 
set to redirect to index-day.html between 6am and 7pm (the 6 and 19 variables). No special code needed for the day and night index pages. Change the links 
as you wish (perhaps to even non-HTML links). A downloadable HTML file of the below is available.

```HTML
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8" />

<title>Links</title>

</head>
<body>
<script type="text/javascript">
// var SpecialRedirectURL = ['night.html','morning.html','day.html','eve.html'];
var SpecialRedirectURL = [
   'index-night.html',
   'index-day.html'
];

function specRedirect() {
  var currentTime = new Date();
  var currentHour = currentTime.getHours();
  var Hour = 0;
  if ( (currentHour >= 6) && (currentHour < 19) ) { Hour = 1; }
//  alert(Hour+' goes to: '+SpecialRedirectURL[Hour]);
  window.location.href = SpecialRedirectURL[Hour];
}  

window.onload = function() {
  specRedirect(); 
}

</script>
</body>
</html>
```
2Ô∏è‚É£ A dark mode wallpaper image for your smartphone

Skip the busy wallpaper photo that your apps are covering and go for simplicity! I created an image that is what I believe to be the largest commonly used resolution for smartphones - 3200 x 1440. It should resize perfectly for any smaller resolution as there are no pixels in it - just dark mode black. The below image can be downloaded as well. Rotate it if you need.
